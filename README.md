# Installation

```

Import project or double click on pom.xml to open it with IntelliJ IDEA.
This version uses an in-memory H2 Database which automatically
loads data from src/main/resources/data.sql. The create.sql file contains the
schema, which is automatically generated by JPA.
Run the Spring Boot Application and open the following adress: http://localhost:8080/.

For other persistance providers like MySQL or PostgreSQL adjust the application.properties file under
src/main/resources/ and uncomment the dependancy in pom.xml:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.mysql</groupId>
    <artifactId>mysql-connector-j</artifactId>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.postgresql</groupId>

    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
```
